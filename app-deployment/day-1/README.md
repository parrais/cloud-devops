# Intro to Cloud Computing

Traditionally companies have their own data centres that provide their digital services.

This tends to be known as 'On Premises' or 'On Prem'.

## Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing = Computing resources accessed over the internet on demand.

- Often has a service platform (GUI)
- Usually has pay-as-you-go pricing
- Go global fast
- Access the cloud from anywhere
- Less to manage/maintain

## Examples of popular cloud services?

- Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video
- Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music
- Outlook, Email services
- Google Maps, Apple Maps
- YouTube
- Microsoft 365
- Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox etc.
- GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket
- Steam, PSN, Xbox Live, Epic Store etc.
- GeForce NOW, Xbox cloud etc.

## Cloud Deployment Models

| Public         | Private        | Hybrid                                   |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Shared tenancy | Single tenancy | Public & Private (e.g. app pub, DB priv) |

- **Public Cloud**
  - Shared tenancy with others
- **Private cloud**
  - Single tenancy, only your org is allowed into the network
- **Hybrid Cloud**
  - A combination of public and private cloud
- **Multi Cloud**
  - A combination of multiple public cloud providers
  - Advantages:
    - Resilience
    - Avoid vendor lock-in
    - Mix-and-match based on specialisation

## Cloud Service Types

| IaaS                  | PaaS                    | SaaS          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Infrastructure        | Platform                | Software      |
| Physical & networking | Give me the environment | 'Out the box' |

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
  - Rent hardware and networking
  - Most amount of responsibility on user
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
  - Rent environment, you code solution
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
  - 'Out the Box' solution
  - Software runs on the cloud and you use it via the internet
- **FaaS (Functions as a Service)**
  - Write a function and set up triggers
  - When the trigger hits the cloud provider runs the function for you

## Advantages and disadvantages of cloud

### Advantages

- Cost efficiency
  - No need to maintain expensive hardware
  - Pay for what you use
  - Less CapEx more OpEx
- Accessibility
- Faster global deployment
- Less responsibility
  - Less maintenance
  - Security (physical)
- Collaboration
- Innovation
  - Easier to experiment, test etc.

### Disadvantages

- Lack of control
- Requires expertise
- Can tax bandwidth
- Lack of ownership of resources
- Different security concerns/points of attack
- Must be managed properly to not lead to spiralling costs
- Vendor lock in
- Compliance issues
- Service outages

## Market share

1. AWS
2. Azure (Microsoft)
3. GCP (Google)

Other providers: AliBaba, CloudFlare, Oracle, Digital Ocean, IBM, SalesForce etc.

AWS --> Lots of services, longest established, lots of documentation, large community.

Azure --> Microsoft ecosystem integration, Azure DevOps.

GCP --> Data focused, Innovative, Global network, Tend to be fairly cheap, Easier to connect with other providers.
